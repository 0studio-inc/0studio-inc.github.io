every day. There is a mountain of great value on the Internet.
The best articles I find, I read many times over.
I like to go back to them to refresh my memory if something does not make
sense.</p> <h3 id="problem"><a href="#problem" class="header-anchor">#</a> Problem</h3> <p>Staying on top of what you want or need to know can be a challenge.
Machine Learning and Data Science are two examples of fields that produce
overwhelming amounts of new technologies, and tools that some of us read about
every day.
The difficulty is that we don't retain or follow up on enough of these valuable
materials that we have luckily came across on the bottomless Internet.</p> <p>Forgetting important content and loosing valuable websites.
These can be some tutorials, lectures, articles that explained something really
well but when after a while you wanted to find that resource again, it was
impossible.
They come up in conversations: you want to share a website you found 2 weeks
ago, and now can't find it in your history anywhere.
Oh, it was a different device, perhaps company laptop.</p> <h4 id="using-information-to-form-beliefs"><a href="#using-information-to-form-beliefs" class="header-anchor">#</a> Using information to form beliefs</h4> <p>“Our experiment quantifies how people weigh their own prior beliefs and the beliefs of others. In our context, there is actually no reason to assume that one’s own estimate is better than anyone else’s. But what we see here is an effect known in psychology as ‘egocentric discounting’ – namely that people put more weight on their own beliefs than on those of others,” explains co-author Alan Noveas Tump, postdoc at the Center for Adaptive Rationality of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. “What’s more, our study reveals that this weighting is strongly impacted by the consistency of others’ beliefs with one’s own: people are more likely to heed information that confirms their own beliefs.”</p> <p>&quot;Forming beliefs in a world of filter bubbles&quot;
