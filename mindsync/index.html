Machine Learning and Data Science are two examples of fields that produce

The difficulty is that we don't retain or follow up on enough of these valuable
materials that we have luckily came across on the bottomless Internet.</p> <p>Forgetting important content and loosing valuable websites.
These can be some tutorials, lectures, articles that explained something really
well but when after a while you wanted to find that resource again, it was
impossible.
They come up in conversations: you want to share a website you found 2 weeks
ago, and now can't find it in your history anywhere.

We habitually browse news-feeds when we need a pause or when we have a spare moment.
Taking that away is infeasible; we do need these pauses.</p> <p>However, if we &quot;<strong>replace</strong> news&quot; with healthier pieces of
information, then we transform a bad habit into a good one while keeping our habit nearly unchanged.
Our pauses are now expected to offer value that matters to us.

That becomes the base of your focused content, which you can expand on for
years.</p> <p>A secure library that individuals can trust and completely control.
Ownership of all data, preferences, metadata must be on the users side.
If user chooses to, they can directly monetize their preferences.</p> <p>The user can leave the platform at any time and retain access to all of their
data.
If they decide to return in a decade, they should be able to do that and leave
again if they wish to with highest convenience.
Users are our customers, and we do everything to accomodate their needs first.</p> <p>If we get to spend more time at reading valuable materials with
understanding, then the complex ideas on paper will start to percolate into our
lives and we will gain the ability to solve more problems.
